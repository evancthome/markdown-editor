# A simple markdown editor

This app will render github flavored markdown with support for TeX expressions. To use TeX expressions, simply wrap the expression between single \$'s for inline rendering, and double \$'s for block rendering.

### Example

```
This will render inline: $f(x) = x^2 + 5$
This will render block: $$f(x) = x^2 + 5$$
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
